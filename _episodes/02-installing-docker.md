Installing Docker is relatively straightforward, particularly because of the excellent
documentation they provide. Still you want to set aside some time to do it properly and
test it out. 

## Installing

Go to the offical [Docker site and their installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
to install Docker for your operating system.

We see no need to go beyond the documentation they provide so we leave it up to you to follow
their installation procedure. 

In the instructions that follow, we assume that Windows users have WSL2 activated with a Linux bash shell (e.g. Ubuntu) and Docker Desktop installed. All commands indicated with "bash" are expected to be typed in this Linux shell.

## Testing

As you walk through their documentation, you will eventually come to a point where you will 
run a very simple test, usually involving their `hello-world` container. 

You can find their documentation for this step [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). 

Testing their code can be summed up by the ability to run (without generating any errors) the following
commands.

~~~
docker --version
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
docker run hello-world
~~~
{: .bash}
